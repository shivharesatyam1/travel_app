# Trip Planner to generate a detailed trip itinerary for your destination

To build this application I have used the Ollama platform (a platform that provides access to large language models similar to OpenAI's GPT) and Gradio (UI)
- Model Used llama3.2:1b (From Ollama)
- Gradio for User Interface

Installation Steps:

1. pip install -r requirement.txt
2. Download ollama in your machine https://ollama.com
3. ollama run llama3.2:1b
4. ollama ps (to verify ollama is running in your local machine)
5. run the jupyter notebook
